# LoRaBLE Encrypted Messenger

> Secure Offline Long-Range Messaging with BLE + LoRa + RSA Encryption

---

```
Phone A <-> BLE <-> Node 1 <--- LoRa ---> Node 2 <-> BLE <-> Phone B
```
Offline peer‑to‑peer communication without internet or cell networks!

---

## 📌 Project Overview
LoRaBLE Messenger is an **end-to-end encrypted**, **offline messaging system** that uses:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for phone ↔ hardware communication  
- **LoRa (Long Range Radio)** for long‑distance transmission  
- **RSA encryption** for secure key‑based messaging  

This project was built as a **B.Tech CSE capstone** demonstrating skills in:  
Android Development • Embedded Systems • Wireless Protocols • Cryptography

---

## 🧠 System Architecture


1️⃣ Encrypt message with receiver’s **public key**  
2️⃣ Send over **BLE** to nearest node  
3️⃣ **LoRa radio** forwards encrypted packet  
4️⃣ Target node relays via **BLE**  
5️⃣ Receiver decrypts via **private key**

# DOM - BLE Messaging App

DOM is a simple Android application demonstrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. It allows users to scan for nearby BLE devices, establish a connection, and send text-based messages.

This project serves as a clear, straightforward example of using Android's native BLE APIs for basic data transfer.

## Features

- **BLE Device Scanning:** Scan for nearby BLE peripherals.
- **Device Connection:** Establish a connection with a selected device from the scan results.
- **Simple Messaging:** Send text messages to the connected device.
- **Modern UI:** Built with modern Material 3 components and a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **Runtime Permissions:** Correctly handles all necessary runtime permissions for Bluetooth functionality on modern Android versions.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch the App:** Open the DOM application.
2.  **Start the Process:** Tap the **"Start BLE Chat"** button.
3.  **Scan for Devices:** On the scan screen, tap the **"Scan for Devices"** button.
4.  **Grant Permissions:** If prompted, grant the necessary Bluetooth and Location permissions.
5.  **Connect to a Device:** A list of nearby devices will appear. Tap on a device to connect to it.
6.  **Chat:** You will be automatically taken to the chat screen. Once the "Services discovered" toast appears, you can send and receive messages.

## Building the Project

This is a standard Android Studio project with no external BLE dependencies.

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Let Gradle sync the project.
4.  Build and run the application on an Android device.
